# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a lightweight, extensible WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) text editor using pure React with no third-party dependencies. The editor will provide basic rich-text editing capabilities through the browser's native contenteditable API and React's state management, offering users an intuitive interface for creating formatted content.

4. WHEN the user selects a link and clicks remove link THEN the system SHALL remove the hyperlink while preserving the text

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to undo and redo my changes, so that I can easily correct mistakes or revert unwanted modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the undo button THEN the system SHALL revert the last editing action
2. WHEN the user clicks the redo button THEN the system SHALL restore the last undone action
3. WHEN there are no actions to undo THEN the system SHALL disable the undo button
4. WHEN there are no actions to redo THEN the system SHALL disable the redo button

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to clear all formatting from selected text, so that I can start fresh with plain text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects formatted text and clicks clear formatting THEN the system SHALL remove all formatting from the selected text
2. WHEN no text is selected and user clicks clear formatting THEN the system SHALL remove formatting from subsequently typed text
3. WHEN clearing formatting THEN the system SHALL preserve the text content while removing all styling

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the editor to maintain focus and cursor position, so that my editing workflow is not interrupted by toolbar interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
